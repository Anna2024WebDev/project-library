# project-library

This week our project was to build a library using arrays as well as DOM manupulations, functions, variables and event handling. Our recipe library page offers options for filtering, sorting, and randomly selecting items.

This project was the first team project as part of the Technigo bootcamp. Working together on the same repository has been a new important experience for us. 
We decided on the project together and build a first HTML and CSS together. We worked on the Javascript codes first idividually and explained and discussed them later on.
