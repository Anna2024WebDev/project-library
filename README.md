# project-library

This week our project was to build a library using arrays as well as DOM manupulations, functions, variables and event handling. Our recipy library page offers options for filtering, sorting, and randomly selecting items.

This week was as also the first team project, it was a new experience working in teams with mobile programming and dividing tasks between each other.
